This little tool auto bulk downloads all of the CC available from TSR, BEO creations, and downwithpatreon.

The items downloaded from TSR are split into subfolders representing their use in the game, to aid in HQ conversion if you want to use the HQ mod.

How to use:

  Install the latest version of node.js somewhere.

  Clone this repository.

  CD into the repositories directory, and run npm install.

  At this point, you have all of the dependencies.

  In the project directory, type npm build to build the project.

  Create a file named .ts4ccadrc.json in the folder with the following:

  {
    "destination": "the/base/directory/where/the/downloads/should/go"
  }

  If you're on linux or OS X, just type npm run start and the magic happens.

  If you're on Windows, things are a little more complicated but not impossible.

  Follow the directions here: http://webservices20.blogspot.com/2015/04/running-terminal-dashboards-on-windows.html

  Now start up a terminal somewhere, cd into the project directory, type npm run start and watch the magic happen.
